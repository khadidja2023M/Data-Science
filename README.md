I am a skilled Machine Learning Engineer with a diverse range of competencies including expertise in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). I excel in data pre-processing,performing tasks such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and data transformation. My experience extends to model development, encompassing the use of deep learning  frameworks like TensorFlow. Additionally, I have a knack for data visualization, using tools like Python , Excel, Power BI and Tableau to convey insights clearly. My commitment to continuous learning and problem solving skills complements my technical prowess, making me a well-rounded Machine Learning Engineer capable of delivering innovative solutions. 
Here are links to some of my recent projects that showcase my expertise and problem-solving abilities:
